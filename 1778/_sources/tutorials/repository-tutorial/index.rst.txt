    :class: info

    This tutorial is intended to familiarize you with the basic concepts of Litestar's
    Data Transfer Objects (DTOs). It is assumed that you are already familiar with
    Litestar and fundamental concepts such as route handlers. If not, it is recommended
    to first follow the `Developing a basic TODO application <../todo-app>`_ tutorial.
    It is also assumed that you have a basic understanding of databases using the
    SQLAlchemy library.

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of modelling a simple database
relationships, and demonstrate how Litestar's repository modules can make working with
databases a breeze. Lets get started!
