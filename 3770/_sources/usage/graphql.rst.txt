Graphql
#######

Litestar does not support ``graphql`` out of the box. This can be done through third party packages.

.. note::
    Currently the only library that supports Litestar is `Strawberry <https://strawberry.rocks/docs/integrations/litestar#litestar>`_.
    Check the official `Graphql <https://graphql.org/community/tools-and-libraries/?tags=python>`_  documentation to learn more about other graphql libraries.
